# Semaphores are used for synchronizing the parent (main code) and the child
# (task). The idea is that the parent will check that the child is actually
# running. In order for this test to be successful the child has to be running!
# To ensure that the child is running semaphores are used. The child will not be
# allowed to finish until the parent has approved it. On the other hand the 
# parent will not be allowed to check for child's process until the child is
# alive and notifies the parent of his existence.
